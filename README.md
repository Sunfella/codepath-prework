## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The main challenge I encountered in creating this project is the formatting of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I would get simple errors such as missing a space or small things like that. I overcame this challenge by carefully examining my work versus the instructions, and reaching out to websites to help me find my errors source. Anorher challenge I encountered wasn't the programming so much, but rather the navigation of github. The youtube videos provided, as well as my peers that are well-versed with github helped me figure out what each tab meant and how to upload certain links.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I always thought web development was done using one coding language, such as HTML. However after completing this project, I've learned that websites are multiple languages melded together to create functional, stylish, and interactive websites. The questions I have for web development is that: will there always be 3 different coding languages used to make up websites? Could it be more or less? Is it always going to be HTML, CSS, and Javascript? What about for mobile apps?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably do more research on fonts and colors alloted in CSS and focus more on making the game aesthetically pleasing. As for the functionality, I would probably add another button to increase difficulty, as well as reduce the clue tone time. Beyond that, I would love to create different levels for the player to complete and award points for competitiveness.
