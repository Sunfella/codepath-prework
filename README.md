## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
While completing this challenge, I had encountered a few undeclared/unitialized variables and unused variables. I realized this was my error becuase I hadn't used the correct format for the javascript class. I overcame this challenge by rereading the directions and carefully examining the lines of code that were giving me errors.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I always thought web development was just one coding language that put together websites, but now I see it is multiple languages that meld with each other to create functional, stylish, and interactive websites.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably do more research on the styling capabilites of CSS, so I can make the game more aesthetically pleasing. As for the function of the game I would try to add another button and decrease the clue tone time. Beyond that, I would try to create different levels of difficulty and award points the further a player can make it. This game, while an old concept that's been around since I was a kid, is addictive and can be played by everyone!
